Time Series Forecasting:

1) Time Series Analysis of Australian Beer Production (Australian_Beer_Production):<br>
Analysis of the time series of Australia's beer production from 1956 to 1995. <br>
Key tools: Time Series Analysis, Seasonal Decomposition, Exploratory Data Analysis <br>
Libraries: statsmodels, statsmodels.tsa, seaborn, matplotlib, numpy, pandas

2) Time Series Forecasting of Monthly Sales (Sales_Forecasting):<br>
The time series for the monthly sales of a certain store between 2013 and 2017 has been analyzed and
used to build a predictive model to forecast the performance of the store in 2018, using different
variants of exponential smoothing. <br>
Key tools: Time Series Analysis and Forecasting, Exponential Smoothing Forecast, Holt's and Holt-Winters' Methods <br>
Libraries: statsmodels.tsa, sklearn, seaborn, matplotlib, numpy, pandas

3) Prediction of the Sales of a Brick Store (Brick_Store_Sales):<br>
The monthly sales of a certain brick and mortar retail store until the end of 2016 has been predicted using different
variants of the ARIMA model. The provided data spans over 2000 to 2015.  <br>
Key tools: Time Series Analysis and Forecasting, ARIMA, SARIMAX <br>
Libraries: statsmodels, statsmodels.tsa, sklearn, itertools, seaborn, matplotlib, numpy, pandas

4)  Demand Forecasting for a Solar Energy Provider (Electric_Load_Forecasting):<br>
A large dataset of the load on the grid, collected at 15-minute intervals, and provided by a solar panel producer,
was leveraged to develop time-series forecasting models (ARIMA- and tree-based) for multi-step prediction of the 
next 24-hour load. <br>
Key tools: Time Series Analysis and Prediction, SARIMAX and Auto ARIMA, XGBoost, Random Forest <br>
Libraries: pmdarima, statsmodels.tsa, xgboost, sklearn, seaborn, matplotlib, numpy, pandas
